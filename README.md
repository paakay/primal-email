A Sample Responsive HTML Email Design for Primal Nutrition, Inc
===============================================================================================

[Primal Passion, LLC]. is a health and nutrition company based in California specializing in **Primal Living** in the Modern World. This is my attempt to convert their current email blasts into a responsive HTML Email that works on more than **_70+ devices_ confirmed by [litmustest.com]**.

HTML email design is tricky with email clients still not up-to-speed with current standards. This design uses graceful degradation and progessive enhancement principles to incorporate modern features and falls back gracefully for older clients.

Future iterations include adding responsive video and audio that works in email clients that support the HTML5 video and audio API. For email clients that don't support the HTML5 feature, a video poster image will show in the email that links to the video hosted on the company's website.
